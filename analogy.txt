Grace targets are limited to  
1) Make long running ops microtasks, that way they can be scheduled or run in a different task
2) Make a variety of autocompletion tools. Don't use a parser. Read code like a human. Is that even possible
3) Maximize use of screen space
4) Lint and beautify code where possible
5) Reduce memory footprint where possible.

Outside Grace scope
1) Compilation
2) Running code
For those it assumes the user has a terminal. Use the terminal command.

Gray Areas
1) Git support
2) File operations
3) File servers

Grace Module Behaviour
- We absorb modules. Since we are not using npm, we keep bundle size down by manually stripping symbols from libraries.
This keeps size small.
