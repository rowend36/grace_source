Coincidentally, that is also the right answer to
how do you spend 3 years building a tiny simple software. :D

In here, you have replicated functionality of
- jquery on cashdom & animejs(jquery_compat)
- axios (ajax)
- antlr (parser)
- ot.js (ext/shared_store)
- lodash/asyncjs (utils)
- node.js path(path)
- node.js events(events_emitter)
- node.js fs(base_fs)
- localForage(ext/async_storage)
- funniest one: entire mobile focus system with
   adaptive keyboard visibility detection(focus_manager)
