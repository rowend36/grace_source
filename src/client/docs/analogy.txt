Docs is supposed to be the equivalent of Editors
for documents. However, it turned out to be a very
large module instead simply because, there are a lot
things you can do with a document e.g search, edit,
file opearations, diff etc. while there are only a few
things you can do with an editor.
This is further worsened by the fact that it is one of the 
oldest parts of this codebase ie from the time when Grace
had not forgotten it is in fact, just a pet project.

Hence, Docs is a messy area.

Attempts to organise it have yielded limited success
in the form of mixins.
base - The minimum functionality for docs as originally planned.
blob - is a wrapper for Config.storage
persist - handles saving and loading documents from storage
save - handles file operations e.g save, rename
tabs - handles tab management
document_commands - Adds useful commands to the editor when a Doc is active

Additional mixins
ext/docs/checkpoints
ext/docs/partial_undo

Doc vs ace.EditSession or ace.Document
Doc fires app events, can be persisted easily and integrates
better with the rest of the application. A lot of stuff
just bail out once they realise they are not dealing with
a Doc.
